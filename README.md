## TODO

- [ ] Add more components

    - [ ] Checkbox
    - [ ] Image
    - [ ] List (`Each` element)
    - [x] Rect/Div
    - [ ] Scrollable 
    - [ ] Select
    - [ ] Text (it's there, but it's weird because i copied the vanilla string widget as a base)
    - [ ] TextArea
    - [ ] TextInput/TextField/TextBox
- [ ] Dynamic (flow) elements and widgets (i.e. If, Each, etc.)
- [ ] Using Mead documents inside others as elements (not sure about that one, but it would be nice coming from Svelte)
- [ ] Data binding
- [ ] Clean up the code (That's gonna hurt)
- [ ] Documentation
